# Agent Coach

Agent Coach is a personal prompting mentor for AI coding agents. It helps you get better at directing tools like Codex or Claude by giving focused coaching, building strong verification habits, and guiding you toward agent‑friendly codebases. The goal is simple: more reliable agent outcomes with less back‑and‑forth.

## Capabilities
- Turn vague requests into clear, testable prompts.
- Build a repeatable verification loop so agents can check their own work.
- Adapt coaching style to your preference: direct, balanced, or encouraging.
- Track progress with levels, streaks, and badges.
- Assess codebase readiness and get prioritized, practical upgrades.

## How It Works
You choose a coach persona and a coaching style. The coach then observes your sessions and gives short, concrete tips tied to what you just did. When you want a snapshot of progress, you can ask for stats. When you want to improve a repository for agents, you can request a readiness analysis and a clear action plan.

## Typical Outcomes
- Clearer prompts that reduce guesswork.
- Faster, more autonomous agent sessions.
- Fewer regressions thanks to stronger verification habits.
- A codebase that both agents and humans can navigate with confidence.
