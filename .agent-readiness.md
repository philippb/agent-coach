# agent-coach - Agent Readiness

## Summary
**Score: 6/10** | Key strengths: install entrypoint plus lint/test scripts, local tool bootstrap, and repo docs. | Critical gaps: no CI, minimal tests.

## Testing [3/10]
Basic bats smoke test added. Run with `scripts/test.sh` (use `scripts/bootstrap-tools.sh` to install bats locally).

## Linting & Formatting [6/10]
ShellCheck + shfmt wired in `scripts/lint.sh` (install via `scripts/bootstrap-tools.sh`).

## Static Analysis [0/10]
No static analysis tooling configured.

## Git Hooks [0/10]
No git hooks or pre-commit framework detected.

## CI/CD [0/10]
No CI configuration found (e.g., `.github/workflows`).

## Agent CLI Tools [5/10]
Entrypoints: `bash install.sh`, `scripts/bootstrap-tools.sh`, `scripts/lint.sh`, `scripts/test.sh`.

## Documentation [6/10]
Repo docs in `README.md` plus agent instructions in `AGENTS.md`.

## Verification Loop
Can agent verify its work? **Partially**
Gaps: no CI, minimal test coverage.

## Recommendations
1. Add CI (GitHub Actions) to run lint + tests on each PR.
2. Expand bats coverage beyond the smoke test (failure paths, reinstall flow).
