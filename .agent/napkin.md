# Napkin

## 2026-02-07
- User preference: napkin instructions should not reference Claude-specific paths; use `.agent/napkin.md`.
- Reminder: when a user says "undo", first check `git status` and revert any working-tree changes before continuing.
- When adding an open-source license, add a `LICENSE` file at repo root and mention it briefly in `README.md`.
